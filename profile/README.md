# 🧠👁️ Welcome to the Zoccolan Lab 🐁🔍

## 🔬 About Us
The Zoccolan Lab (@SISSA, Trieste) is a research group focused on unraveling the mysteries of visual perception. We explore how the brain decodes and interprets visual information.
Our research aims at understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying visual object recognition, using a combination of psychophysics, electrophysiology, and computational modeling.
